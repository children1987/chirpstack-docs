# The ChirpStack project

ChirpStack is an open-source LoRaWAN Network Server which can be used to
setup private or public LoRaWAN networks. ChirpStack provides a web-interface
for the management of gateways, devices and tenants as well to setup data
integrations with the major cloud providers, databases and services commonly
used for handling device data. ChirpStack provides a gRPC based API that can
be used to integrate or extend ChirpStack.
